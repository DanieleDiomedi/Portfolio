# Daniele Diomedi â€“ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my personal repository.  
I'm Daniele, a cybersecurity student with a technical, direct, and results-driven approach.  
My goal is to become a well-rounded expert in both defense (Blue Team) and offense (Red Team), by building strong skills in:

- **Advanced Networking**
- **Operating Systems (Linux, Windows Server)**
- **Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Python Scripting**
- **Endpoint Hardening & Security**
- **Threat Intelligence and OSINT**

## Objectives

- Master both attack and defense to deeply understand security from all sides
- Build a real, technical portfolio: labs, scripts, reports, configurations
- Learn by doing: I prioritize practice over abstract theory
- Prepare to enter the field as a hands-on cybersecurity professional

## Technologies and Tools

- Kali Linux (XFCE, CLI first)
- VirtualBox & Hyper-V
- Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS, Snort, Suricata
- Windows Server, Active Directory
